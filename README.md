## FAQ

- Why does this code suck so much? 

  The short answer is that I wrote it in a weekend when I was a freshman, and every new feature has been crammed on top of the existing JS. Does it work? It works pretty well, I guess? It could definitely be better.

- Please bring Firehose to <x> school!

  I'm happy to help do this, although I'm not going to write new scrapers (as of July 2020), so there's some work to be done there. Still, if you're interested, I think it's definitely workable.
