Also focuses on unsupervised learning of data representations, with an emphasis on hierarchical (deep) architectures.","rr":[],"f":false,"la":false,"no":"9.520","u1":3,"l":[[[[36,3],[96,3]],"46-3002"]],"u3":9,"u2":0,"nx":false,"re":false,"s":["l"],"r":[],"lr":["TR11-12.30"],"t":["FA"],"h":12.6,"si":86.0,"u":"","sa":"6.860","tb":false,"pl":false,"ra":5.8},"8.399":{"ci":false,"co":"8","cl":"399","hs":false,"hh":false,"le":"G","br":[],"n":"Physics Teaching","mw":"","ha":false,"cw":false,"he":false,"pr":"Permission of instructor","b":[],"rp":true,"d":"For qualified graduate students interested in gaining some experience in teaching.
