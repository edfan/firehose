Considers how, in response to the naming of the Anthropocene and anxieties over ecological crises, researchers in various fields have turned to plants as central players. Using this as a starting point, explores how researchers have described and re-calibrated relations among plants, humans, and environment, between life and non-life, action and being, subjectivity and autonomy in ways that radically altered ruling epistemologies in a range of disciplines. Looks at how philosophers, farmers, foresters, eco-critics, geographers, botanists, and popular science writers adapted research questions and narratives to incorporate not only plant uses, but plant intelligence and sentience.","n":"Multi-Species Histories of Plant People, Wild and Cultivated","i":"Brown, Kathryn","v":false,"nx":true,"rp":false,"u":"","f":false,"ra":0,"h":0,"si":0},"STS.464":{"no":"STS.464","co":"STS","cl":"464","tb":false,"s":["l"],"l":[[[[14,6]],"E51-393"]],"r":[],"b":[],"lr":["M EVE (3-6 PM)"],"rr":[],"br":[],"hh":false,"ha":false,"hs":false,"he":false,"ci":false,"cw":false,"re":false,"la":false,"pl":false,"u1":3,"u2":0,"u3":9,"le":"G","sa":"","mw":"","t":["SP"],"pr":"None","d":"Examines the rise and development of computing technologies in the global south.

Feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. Focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. Special attention to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge. What makes research distinctively feminist lies in the complex connections between epistemologies, methodologies and research methods. Explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and/or problematic for feminist inquiry and what, specifically, are the feminist critiques of these intersections.","n":"Feminist Inquiry: Strategies for Effective Scholarship","i":"Lantz, Stacey","v":true,"nx":false,"rp":true,"u":"","f":false,"ra":0,"h":0,"si":0},"WGS.645":{"no":"WGS.645","co":"WGS","cl":"645","tb":false,"s":[],"l":[],"r":[],"b":[],"lr":[],"rr":[],"br":[],"hh":false,"ha":false,"hs":false,"he":false,"ci":false,"cw":false,"re":false,"la":false,"pl":false,"u1":3,"u2":0,"u3":9,"le":"G","sa":"","mw":"","t":["SP"],"pr":"Application to the Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies","d":"Syllabi vary depending on instructors.","n":"Issues of Representation: Feminist Theory","i":"Lantz, Stacey","v":true,"nx":false,"rp":true,"u":"","f":false,"ra":0,"h":0,"si":0},"WGS.S10":{"no":"WGS.S10","co":"WGS","cl":"S10","tb":false,"s":["l"],"l":[[[[82,6]],"14E-310"]],"r":[],"b":[],"lr":["W EVE (7-10 PM)"],"rr":[],"br":[],"hh":false,"ha":false,"hs":false,"he":false,"ci":false,"cw":false,"re":false,"la":false,"pl":false,"u1":3,"u2":0,"u3":9,"le":"U","sa":"","mw":"","t":["FA","SP"],"pr":"None","d":"Covers topics not included in regular curriculum; taught in seminar format.
