Case studies include articles and films that address engineering disasters, safety, biotechnology, the internet and AI, and the ultimate scope and aims of engineering.&nbsp; Different sections may focus on themes, such as AI or biotechnology. Students taking independent inquiry version 6.9041 will expand the scope of their term project. Students taking 20.005 focus their term project on a problem in biological engineering in which there are intertwined ethical and technical issues. In person not required.
